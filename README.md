### Background
I bought myself a fancy water-cooled app-controlled wifi-enabled mattress topper almost 3 years ago. The youtube influencers worked.

In the 3 years I've owned it, I have:
- Woken up in a puddle of water after the system leaked
- Received an entire replacement system (shipped at my expense)
- Dealt with a frustrating, slow app experience
- Had previously accessible app features become locked behind an app subscription paywall
- Gone to bed to find a wet mattress from the leaking replacement topper
- Been refused another replacement as the original unit's warranty is expired
- Seen the extended 5-year warranty also locked behind the app subscription paywall
- Seen the limited and undocumented manufacturer's API disabled entirely

### Purpose
I would like to document, repair, and possibly improve this device. Although my experience has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing, the ability to have a mattress adjust my temperature while I sleep has been wonderful.

### Goals
- Deconstruct and document the leaking mattress topper(s)
- Develop a repair method to restore the functionality of the water cooling system
- Disassemble and document the process of opening the hub unit
- Interact with the internal hub software, if possible, to bypass the always-online issues encountered with the app
- Develop an open-source replacement software/hardware solution for the hub to completely disconnect from the online services
